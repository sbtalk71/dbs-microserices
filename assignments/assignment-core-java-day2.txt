1. Create a Java Project with relevant packages
2. Create a class Customer as follows:
public class Customer {
private int custId;
private String customerName;

//create default Constructor
//create Constructor with all parameters
//generate setter and getter for all variables

}


3. Create a class named CustomerDB as given:
public class CustomerDB {
	
	private Customer[] customerList=new Customer[6];
	
	//write the no args constructor and populate the Customer[] array with 6 Customer Objects
	// example code would be like 
	//	Customer[0]=new Customer(100,"John");
	// so goes for other 5 objects
	//implement the following method
	
	public String findCustomerById(int id) throws CustomerNotFoundException{
		//write the finder logic here which searches the array for the object of Customer with the given id (custId in Customer class)
		
	}
		
}

4. Write a program to serialize the above CusomerDB to a file named "csuomerDB.ser". Make necessary adjustments to the class for Serialization.

5. Write an application/Program to de serialize the CustomerDB and call findCustomerById method to search a Customer by custId;
